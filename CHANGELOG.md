# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- **Unique values popup** (`u`) — searchable overlay showing all distinct values for the current column sorted by frequency; press `Enter` to instantly apply as a filter
- **Comparison filters** — filter mode now accepts `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `=`, `!=` for numeric columns (e.g. `> 30`); `=` and `!=` also work for exact string matching

### Fixed
- Plot no longer fills the screen with solid dots on large datasets — data is downsampled to the chart width before rendering

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- **Column Inspector** (`i`) — full-screen table showing every column's type, count, null count, unique count, min, max, mean, and median
- **Histogram plot** — third plot type cycled with `t` (line → bar → histogram); bins computed via Sturges' rule

### Fixed
- Categorical X-axis labels in plot mode no longer consume more than 1/3 of the screen for long string values

### Performance
- Table rendering is now O(viewport height) instead of O(total rows) — large files no longer freeze the UI
